# My Neovim Config

This repo contains all my [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config files, which I use.

## If you want to also use it

Please note that this config is only guaranteed (not really) to work on Linux and might or might not work on Mac OS.

1. Install Neovim at https://neovim.io/doc/install/
2. Install Git if it's not already installed via your distros package manager.
3. Make a backup of your current nvim config folder
```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
```
4. Clone my nvim config
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VeryUsual/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
5. Open neovim
```bash
nvim
```
